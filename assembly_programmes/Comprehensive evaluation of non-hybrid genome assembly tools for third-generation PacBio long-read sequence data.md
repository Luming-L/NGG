Comprehensive evaluation of 
non-hybrid genome assembly tools for 
third-generation PacBio long-read sequence data

non-hybrid genome assembly tools
10 long-read assemblers
different taxonomic categories 
different genome size



## Long-read assembly pipelines
algorithms for de novo assembly 
- Overlap layout consensus (OLC) approach 
- de Bruijn graphs 
- string graphs 
SMS data has the high error rates. Hence, de Bruijn graphs was unfeasible, OLC approach and the string graphs are more suitable.
