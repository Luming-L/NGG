## Long-read assembly pipelines
algorithms for de novo assembly 
- Overlap layout consensus (OLC) approach 
- de Bruijn graphs 
- string graphs 
SMS data has the high error rates. Hence, de Bruijn graphs was unfeasible, OLC approach and the string graphs are more suitable.
Currently, most long-read OLC pipelines follow a hierarchical approac
