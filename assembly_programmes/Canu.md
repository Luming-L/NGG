Genomic repeats longer than read length will disturb overlapping of reads. Single-molecule sequencing can produce reads > 10kb, but it is less accurate.

PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and Oxford Nanopore strand sequencing have their own characters and requirements for assembly. 

New approaches come out to deal with data with increased read length and error rate. These can be roughly categorised as hybrid, hierarchical or direct methods.
