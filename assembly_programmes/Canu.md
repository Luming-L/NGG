Genomic repeats longer than read length will disturb overlapping of reads. Single-molecule sequencing can produce reads > 10kb, but it is less accurate.

PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and Oxford Nanopore strand sequencing have their own characters and requirements for assembly. 

New approaches come out to deal with data with increased read length and error r
