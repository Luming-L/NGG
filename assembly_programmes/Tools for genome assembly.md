The bioinformatics tools for the genome assembly and
analysis based on third-generation sequencing

## Keywords
- Bioinformatics tools
- third-generation sequencing
- genome assembly
- genome sequencing

We review a total of 39 TGS analysis tools, which were either recently published or developed (TableS1).
We discuss their various characteristics,such as the required input, interaction with the user, sequencing platforms,type of reads, error models, possibility of introducing coverage bias, simulation of genomic variants and output provided.
This review evaluates various tools applied in three main TGS platforms on genome assembly and further analysis.
Details of each approach along with its benefits and drawbacks are discussed. 
Two distinct decision trees are presented to guide researchers for selecting a suitable TGS de novo and genome-based sequencing analysis tools.
## De novo assembly using TGS technologies
De novo long-read genome assembly involves in several steps:
- raw read mapping
- read error correction
- assembly of corrected reads
- assembly polishing
- 
### Genome alignment and assembly tools for TGS platform
### Sequencing tools for hybrid technologies of both NGS and TGS

## Tools for genome-based sequence analysis
