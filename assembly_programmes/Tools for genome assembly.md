The bioinformatics tools for the genome assembly and
analysis based on third-generation sequencing

## Keywords
- Bioinformatics tools
- third-generation sequencing
- genome assembly
- genome sequencing

We review a total of 39 TGS analysis tools, which were either recently published or developed (TableS1).
We discuss their various characteristics,such as the required input, interaction with the user, sequencing platforms,type of reads, error models, possibility of introducing coverage bias, simulation of genomic variants and output provided.
This review evaluates various tools applied in three main TGS platforms on genome assembly and further analysis.
Details of each approach along with its benefits and drawbacks are discussed. 
Two distinct decision trees are presented to guide researchers for selecting a suitable TGS de novo and genome-based sequencing analysis tools.
## De novo assembly using TGS technologies
De novo long-read genome assembly involves in several steps:
- raw read mapping
- read error correction
	- align long reads against themselves
	- use short reads to correct long reads 
- assembly of corrected reads
- assembly polishing

for all overlap
overlap-based procedures such as overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) algorithms
- generate alignments between long reads
- calculate the best overlap graph
- generate the consensus sequence of the contigs from the graph
