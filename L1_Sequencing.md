## PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time sequencing (SMRT)
good for de novo Genome Assembly

### Process of SMRT:
- library preparation
	+ ligate adapters to double strand DNA to create circular template
	+ immobilize DNA polymerase with a single molecule of single stranded DNA template and primer to 
	+ Inside each ZMW, a single active DNA polymerase with a single molecule of single stranded DNA template is immobilized to the bottom
	+ add primers, polymerase, DNA template to ZMW (zero-mode waveguides, A SMRT cell containing millions of tiny wells)
- sequencing
	+ add nucleotides attached with fluorescent dyes
	+ polymerase-cooperated labelled nucleotides 
	+ measure nucleotides in real-time

### advantages 
- Long Reads
	+ reads tens of kilobases in length	
	+ assemble complete genomes and sequence full-length transcripts
- High Accuracy
	+ Sequencing free of systematic error achieves >99.999% consensus accuracy.
- Uniform Coverage
	+ No bias based on GC content means you can sequence through region inaccessible to other technologies.
- Single-Molecule Resolution
	+ Capturing sequence data from native DNA or RNA molecules enables highly accurate long reads with >99% single-molecule accuracy.
- Epigenetics
	+ With no PCR amplification step, base modifications are directly detected during sequencing.
### why select this approach

long reads, the highest consensus accuracy, uniform coverage, simultaneous epigenetic detection
