## PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time sequencing (SMRT)
good for de novo Genome Assembly

### Process of SMRT:
- library preparation
	+ ligate adapters to double strand DNA to create circular template
	+ add primers and polymerase to the library on the sequencing instrument
	+ mobilize single molecule DNA into zero-mode waveguides (ZMW, A SMRT cell containing millions of tiny wells)
- sequencing
	+ add polymerase-cooperated labelled nucleotides 
	+ measure nucleotides in real-time

### advantages 

### why select this approach

long reads, the highest consensus accuracy, uniform coverage, simultaneous epigenetic detection
