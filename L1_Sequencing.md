## PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time sequencing (SMRT)
good for de novo Genome Assembly

### Process of SMRT:
- library preparation
	+ ligate adapters to double strand DNA to create circular template
	+ add primers and polymerase to the library on the sequencing instrument
	+ mobilize single molecule DNA into zero-mode waveguides (ZMW, A SMRT cell containing millions of tiny wells)
- sequencing
	+ add polymerase-cooperated labelled nucleotides 
	+ measure nucleotides in real-time

### advantages 
**Long Reads**

With reads tens of kilobases in length you can readily assemble complete genomes and sequence full-length transcripts.

### Explore the benefits of long reads

----------

**High Accuracy**

Sequencing free of systematic error achieves >99.999% consensus accuracy.

### Learn more about high accuracy

----------

**Uniform Coverage**

No bias based on GC content means you can sequence through region inaccessible to other technologies.

### Discover how uniform coverage lets you see more

----------

**Single-Molecule Resolution**

Capturing sequence data from native DNA or RNA molecules enables highly accurate long reads with >99% single-molecule accuracy.

### See the difference single-molecule resolution makes

----------

**Epigenetics**

With no PCR amplification step, base modifications are directly detected during sequencing.
### why select this approach

long reads, the highest consensus accuracy, uniform coverage, simultaneous epigenetic detection
