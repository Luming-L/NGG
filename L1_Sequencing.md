## PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time sequencing (SMRT)
good for de novo Genome Assembly

### Process of SMRT:
- library preparation
	+ ligate adapters to double strand DNA to create circular template
	+ immobilize DNA polymerase with a single molecule of DNA template and primer to a ZMW (zero-mode waveguides, tiny wells in a SMRT cell)
- sequencing
	+ add nucleotides attached with fluorescent dyes
	+ detect the fluorescent signal of the nucleotide incorporated by the DNA polymerase as DNA synthesizes


### advantages 
- Long Reads
	+ reads tens of kilobases in length	
	+ assemble complete genomes and sequence full-length transcripts
- High Accuracy
	+ Sequencing free of systematic error achieves >99.999% consensus accuracy.
- Uniform Coverage
	+ No bias based on GC content means you can sequence through region inaccessible to other technologies.
- Single-Molecule Resolution
	+ Capturing sequence data from native DNA or RNA molecules enables highly accurate long reads with >99% single-molecule accuracy.
- Epigenetics
	+ With no PCR amplification step, base modifications are directly detected during sequencing.
### why select this approach

long reads, the highest consensus accuracy, uniform coverage, simultaneous epigenetic detection
