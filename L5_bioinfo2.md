# Hidden Markov Models HMMs
extension of Markov chain
Fair Bet Casino Example 
Head or Tail - observed
Fair or B - path (known - in HMM this is unknown)

pi - path sequence
x - emission sequence - 

What happen if we don't know the path
each possible path that will generate the sequence, the highest possibility
 learn the possibility



p(x, M) - decode

model M, sequence x, P(x|M)
Estimate transition probabilities
a model and new data - find the hidden state sequence
