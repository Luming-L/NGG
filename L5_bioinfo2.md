# Hidden Markov Models HMMs
extension of Markov chain
Fair Bet Casino Example 
Head or Tail - observed
Fair or B - path (known - in HMM this is unknown)

pi - path sequence
x - emission sequence - 

What happen if we don't know the path
each possible path that will generate the sequence, the highest possibility
 learn the possibility

recursion for estimating probability
calculate the transigiven data

p(x, M) - decode

model M, sequence x, P(x|M)
Estimate transition probabilities
a model and new data - find the hidden state sequence
